# API Design Principles

This document outlines the general principles and patterns used in the PrayerGlow API design. 

## Overview

The PrayerGlow API follows RESTful principles with a focus on simplicity, security, and performance. This document describes the general approach rather than specific implementation details.

## API Design Philosophy

Our API is designed with the following principles in mind:

### 1. Resource-Oriented

- APIs are organized around resources
- Resources are accessed via standard HTTP methods
- Relationships between resources are reflected in URL structure

### 2. Consistent Conventions

- Consistent naming patterns across endpoints
- Standardized response formats
- Uniform error handling

### 3. Security-First

- Authentication required for all non-public endpoints
- Authorization checks at multiple levels
- Sensitive data protection

### 4. Mobile-Optimized

- Efficient payloads to minimize bandwidth
- Batched operations where appropriate
- Pagination for large data sets

## Authentication

The API uses a token-based authentication system:

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- Tokens include necessary claims while minimizing payload size
- Refresh token approach for extended sessions

## Request & Response Patterns

### Request Format

APIs accept data in the following formats:

- JSON data in request bodies
- Query parameters for filtering and pagination
- Path parameters for resource identification

### Response Format

Responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "data": { /* Response data */ },
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalItems": 42
  }
}
```

### Error Format

Errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human-readable message",
    "details": { /* Optional error details */ }
  }
}
```

## Common Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Successful request
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully
- `204 No Content`: Success with no response body
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required
- `403 Forbidden`: Permission denied
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Validation errors
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

## Resource Categories

The API is organized into the following resource categories:

### User Resources

- Authentication and user management
- User preferences and settings
- Access control

### Content Resources

- Primary application content
- User-generated content
- Content categorization

### Subscription Resources

- Subscription management
- Feature access verification
- Receipt validation

## API Versioning

The API uses URL-based versioning:

- Version prefix in URL path (e.g., `/v1/resources`)
- Backward compatibility within a version
- Breaking changes introduce new versions

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination through consistent parameters:

- `page`: Page number (1-based)
- `limit`: Items per page
- Response includes metadata about total pages and items

## Rate Limiting

APIs implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- Limits differ based on endpoint and user type
- Rate limit information included in response headers
- Gradual backoff for exceeded limits

## Webhook Support

For certain events, the API provides webhook notifications:

- Configurable webhook URLs
- Standardized payload format
- Versioned webhook events
- Retry logic for failed deliveries

## Security Considerations

The API implements several security measures:

- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- API-specific authorization rules
- Protection against common attack vectors

## Best Practices for API Consumers

- Implement proper error handling
- Honor rate limits and use exponential backoff
- Cache appropriate responses
- Validate webhook signatures
- Use proper token storage and handling
